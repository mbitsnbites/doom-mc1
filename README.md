# MC1-DOOM

This is the classic game DOOM (by id Software) ported to the
[MRISC32](https://mrisc32.bitsnbites.eu/)-based computer
[MC1](https://github.com/mrisc32/mc1).

MC1-DOOM is based on the original linuxdoom code base from 1997, with some
bugfixes and alterations to make it work on MRISC32, and of course graphics
and I/O routines for the MC1 computer.
